### How to Contribute to Dropman

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Dropman! We appreciate any help we can get, whether it's finding bugs, improving the codebase, or adding new features.

#### Getting Started

Before you start contributing, please ensure to have a basic understanding of the project's purpose and functionality. You can refer to the [README.md](https://github.com/IyiolaJay/dropman/blob/main/README.md) file for more information.

### Fork and Clone the Project

To contribute to Dropman, you need to first fork the project and create a local clone of the forked repository on your machine. You can do this by following these steps:

1. Go to the Dropman repository on GitHub.
2. Click the "Fork" button in the top right corner to create a copy of the repository on your own GitHub account.
3. Clone the forked repository to your local machine using

```js
git clone https://github.com/IyiolaJay/dropman.git
```

4. Navigate to the root directory of the project with cd dropman.

### Create a Dev Branch

- Before making any changes to the codebase, create a new branch for your development work. You can do this by running `git checkout -b dev` in the terminal. This will create a new branch named "dev" that you can use for your development work.

### Make Changes

- Now that you have a local copy of the project and a dev branch to work on, you can start making changes to the codebase. Please make sure to follow the project's coding conventions and guidelines, which you can find in the readme.md file.

### Add Your Name to Contributors

- After forking the project and making changes, we kindly ask you to add your name to the contributors.md file. This file contains a list of all the contributors to the project, and we want to make sure your contributions are properly recognized.

### Create a Pull Request

Note: Once you have made your changes and added your name to the contributors file, you can create a pull request to merge your changes into the dev branch on the main repository. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Commit your changes using `git commit -m "Description of changes made"`.
2. Push your changes to the remote repository using git push origin dev.
3. Go to your forked repository on GitHub and click the "New pull request" button.
4. Select the "dev" branch on your forked repository as the source branch, and the "dev" branch on the main repository as the target branch.
5. Add a description of your changes and any other relevant information in the pull request form.
6. Submit the pull request and wait for it to be reviewed and merged by the project maintainers.
